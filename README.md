# Balatro Dual Calculator
This is a dual calculator used to compute Balatro scores. I've made it to easily compute scores for the board game version I recently made.

## So what do I mean by "Dual Calculator?"
There are two values in a Balatro score: Chips and Mult. These both need to be computed seperately, then multiplied by each other. I had initially used the Calculator app on my phone to do the calculations, but that meant I could only calculate either Chips or Mult. This calculator is actually **two** calculators next to each other.

Use this all you want. I'm sure you won't have as much need for it as I do.
